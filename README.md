# Signal_list_generator

This is an attempt to make my repetitive work to be done by python.
Problem : I have to prepare signal list for my project. (Common document required for electrical, automation and process engineers.). Most of the time there are few typical instances which are repeated with some changes in the process name, communication addresses etc etc. 

Solution : With this python script you can prepare just template with some variables. These variables and the instances of template will be define in one common file called parameter list. On running this script it will take each template file instantiate it with variable values from parameter file.  Checkout the example for more details. 

You can use technically unlimited variables. It has created wonders for me and saved tonnes of time for me. Check the example for better understanding.

Feel free to contribute. Any suggestion or ideas are welcome.
